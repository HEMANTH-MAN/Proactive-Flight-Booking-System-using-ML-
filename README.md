# Proactive-Flight-Booking-System-using-ML

This is a ML Project that focuses on how to work with the imbalanced datesets.

- Worked with imbalanced datasets.
- Created a model that more generalizes rather than memorizes.
- Deployed them using the Streamlit Application.
- Containerized the entire Application for more light-weight , portable and independent.
